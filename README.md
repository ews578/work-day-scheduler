Description

The goal of this project was to build a functioning work day scheduler, one that would allow the user to save events for each hour of a typical working day. It features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript and jQuery, and Dayjs library.


There is a display in the header of the current date and time, updating every second with the current time.
The scheduler features 9 time-blocks, starting at 9am and ending at 5pm. The color of each text-block will change color depending on whether it is in the past(grey), present(red), or future(green).
Any text entered into the text field of an individual time-block can be saved to local storage using the provided save button. Once in local storage, it will remain displayed in that time-block upon reloading of the page.
